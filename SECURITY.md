## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AI Engineering Stockholm community takes the security of our website and community resources seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our website or any of our resources, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [your-security-email@example.com] with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Response Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

- Confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days
- Provide an estimated time frame for addressing the vulnerability
- Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed

## Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of coordinated vulnerability disclosure:

- The security issue will be resolved as quickly as possible
- The reporter will be kept informed of the progress
- The vulnerability will be publicly disclosed after it has been resolved
